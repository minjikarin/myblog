    description = "Hi! I'm Minji KIM, a developer advocate at Amadeus for Developers. With over 7 years of experience working abroad, I have a passion for travel, cultural differences, and technology. I mainly help developers build travel applications with Amadeus Travel APIs more efficiently by providing technical materials. I am also fascinated by the Open-Source world, where people contribute their skills and knowledge to help each other, fostering a sense of trust and a shared vision. I also love understanding different cultures by traveling. I am from South Korea, working in France after a 6-year stint in Thailand. This website is for you to check my contents from everywhere. Enjoy!"
